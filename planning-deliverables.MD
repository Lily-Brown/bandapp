# BandApp
## Scope
BandApp will be an application that allows bands and musicians to find each other. Users will be able to sign up and log in as a Band or a Musician, view/edit their profile and browse either Bands or Musicians (whichever they're looking for!). Users then have the option to Connect with Bands/Musicians and start the communications rolling in!
